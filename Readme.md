The scheduled folder is dead.

Thanks to RSI, I'm trying to limit the amount that I am typing, so I won't get into why just now.

But this is a collection of files meant to make certain things easier. Right now it's just meant to be a way to track weekly attendance in a CSV. It used to be much more ambitious.

But, TODO:
- Connect the bot to the Google Drive API to update CSV reports as they're being created (do CSVs have a file history on google drive? If not, make it directly editable through a spreadsheet.).
- Have the bot flush data once the CSV reaches a certain number of entries (6k entries? That's 2-3 weeks)
- Introduce slash commands to identify channels to read rather than search all of them.
- Connect the bot to Zoom to get usage report data from there???
