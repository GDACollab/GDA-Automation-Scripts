The scheduled folder is dead.

Thanks to RSI, I'm trying to limit the amount that I am typing, so I won't get into why just now.

But this is a collection of files meant to make certain things easier. Right now it's just meant to be a way to track weekly attendance in a CSV. It used to be much more ambitious.

But, TODO:
- Connect the bot to Zoom to get usage report data from there???
